Embedded Systems project which is designing a simple calculator using atmega32 micro controller.
The basic idea of a calculator is to provide a convenient and efficient tool for performing mathematical calculations. It is designed to perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and so on.

Features:
-you can perform mathematical operations on numbers up to any digits in first row.
-can do basic mathematical operations ( + , - , * , / ) between two integer number.
-must press ON/C button to make Calculator to work. 
-handle syntax error and math error(infinity).
-handle floating results in case '/'.
-Screen will be cleared if ON/C button pressed.

hardware Components:
1. LCD 
2. Keypad
software layers :-
1- MCAL layer: GPIO.
2- HAL layer: LCD(4 bit mode) and Keypad module.
3- Application layer.
